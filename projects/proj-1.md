title: 'Unity MiniGame'
---

The game is set in a stylized, low-poly world, where players navigate through various levels with increasing difficulty. The simple controls and clear objectives make it an approachable experience for both casual players and those interested in seeing Unity's potential for creating vibrant, minimalist game environments.


### Purpose & Development
Developed during 2021 as part of my search for an internship, the game serves as a demonstration of my skills in Unity, including game design, programming, and the implementation of 3D environments. It was created with the goal of showcasing my ability to design interactive experiences while keeping the gameplay simple and fun.
