title: 'Crowd Simulation'
---

This project showcases an interactive crowd simulation using GPU acceleration through Niagara, with Position-Based Dynamics (PBD) to manage large-scale crowd interactions. The focus is on optimizing computational efficiency for crowd behavior, ensuring real-time collision handling, and enhancing interactive capabilities. Additionally, Vertex Animation Textures (VAT) are used to provide efficient animation, seamlessly integrating into Unreal Engine to create immersive and responsive gaming experiences.

You can view the demo of this simulation in the video below:
